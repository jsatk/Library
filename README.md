# Library

Hello.  This is a personal library of sorts.  These are all the papers,
textbooks, articles, etc., which I have read or want to read.  Inclusion of
something in here does not automatically or implicitly mean I agree with the
opinions or views therein or of the authors.

Everything in here is available for free online at the URL(s) listed inside of
each book's folder under `urls.txt`.  Often many of these texts are also
available for purchase as well.  If I have erroneously included a text in here
that is not free or the author simply doesn't want me including it here please
shoot me an email at `jesse [at] jsatk [dot] us` or open a PR removing it and
I'll be happy to take it out.

I started this after finding a few others online (notably [isis agora
lovecruft's](https://github.com/isislovecruft/library--)) and was inspired to do
the same.

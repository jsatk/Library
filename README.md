# Library

Hello.  This is a personal library of sorts.  These are all the papers,
textbooks, articles, etc., which I have read or want to read.  Inclusion of
something in here does not automatically or implicitly mean I agree with the
opinions or views therein or of the authors.

I started this after finding a few others online (notably [isis agora
lovecruft's](https://github.com/isislovecruft/library--)) and was inspired to do
the same.
